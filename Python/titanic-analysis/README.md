This project explores survival data from the Titanic using the Seaborn Titanic dataset.

## Contents

- `analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), survival rate comparisons, confidence intervals, and logistic regression.
- Cleaned, grouped survival data with 95% confidence intervals
- Bar plots and statistical insights about which groups had the highest and lowest chances of survival.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, StatsModels)
- Google Colab
- GitHub for version control

## Future Work
- Add logistic regression visualizations
- Consider hypothesis testing for more factors
- Build interactive dashboards with Plotly or Streamlit
